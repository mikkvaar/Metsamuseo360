This cabin, built in the 1950s by Mets√§hallitus, represents the final phase of these cabins. Originally, the cabin's compound included a stable, sauna, woodshed, and a wooden structure for management.</div><div><br></div><div>The conditions of the cabin were influenced by the Cabin Act of 1947, which ensured significantly better living conditions. Each man was entitled to his own bed and a locker for personal belongings. Additionally, the cabin had separate drying facilities for wet gear. According to the Cabin Act of 1928, no more than 24 men could be accommodated in one room. The cabin has two accommodation areas, one at each end, each accommodating 12 bunk beds.</div><div><br></div><div>According to the Cabin Act, cabins housing at least 20 workers were required to have a cabin hostess who prepared meals and ensured cleanliness. In this cabin, the kitchen is located in the center. Behind the kitchen, there is a sleeping area reserved for the hostesses, which was off-limits to the loggers.</div><div><br></div><div>Since its relocation to the museum, changes have been made to Ahmakuusikko Cabin. Electricity and running water have been installed in the building. The current toilet facilities occupy the original location of one of the drying rooms.<br></div></div><div><br></div>"

In the remote wilderness where logging operations were located, provisions and necessary goods were initially transported by horse, with some distances covered by just carrying the loads by man. Caravans of dozens of horses carried thousands of kilos of provisions and other goods to the main camp and camp merchants. Each sled could carry about 150-200 kg of goods.</div><div><br></div><div>After the wars, goods were transported by trucks, buses, boats, and horses. With the improvement of roads, truck transport increased, allowing logging camps to receive more fresh food ingredients.</div><div><br></div><div>FOOD GROUPS</div><div>Before the 1947 cabin law, cabin hostesses were still relatively rare. However, even in the 1920s, there were women at some cabins who cooked and sold food to the men.</div><div>Before the widespread presence of hostesses, it was common for men to form small food groups.</div><div><br></div><div>The leader of the food group purchased food supplies from the logging camp merchant. Costs were shared among the group members. The leader kept track of each man's meals and charged according to the amount of food consumed. If there was a hostess in the cabin, she prepared the food from the ingredients purchased by the food group leader.</div><div><br></div><div>LOGGING CAMP MERCHANTS</div><div>\"What you can't find in the camp store is not needed!\"</div><div>The first logging camp stores appeared near the main cabins as early as the early 1900s. The heyday was from 1950 to 1965, when Lapland's logging camps were at their largest and trade was brisk.</div><div><br></div><div>The camp merchant was called the \"hartsu lord,\" supplier, or warehouse keeper. Often, the camp store was run by a local merchant, but it could also be managed as a side job by the camp foreman or a literate laborer.</div><div><br></div><div>Supplies for the store were ordered using the telephone in the main cabin. The supplier had to ensure that there was enough stock for at least three days at a time.</div><div>The main responsibility for the logging camp's logistics lay with the merchant, who received orders from the camps, forwarded them, purchased goods, and supervised transportation. Sometimes, the same merchant could manage several different logging camp stores simultaneously.</div><div><br></div><div>Food supplies arrived at the store in large barrels, boxes, and sacks. During winter frosts, items froze solid, and the merchant had to chop frozen butter into smaller pieces, for instance, so it could be weighed and sold.</div></div></div><div><br></div>"

Smaller amounts of logs had been floated before that. At first, floating was only allowed for a period of 25 days to protect salmon. The logs also had to be debarked so that bark pieces wouldn‚Äôt disturb fish stocks.</div><div><br></div><div>Early floats were so-called ‚Äúwild floats‚Äù, in which all the logs were rolled into the river at once. This often caused log jams. Because wild floats could only be done during flood waters, it was dangerous work that demanded lots of manpower.</div><div>As the amount of logs to be floated in River Kemi increased, the logging companies combined their floats together. To manage this the River Kemi Log Floating Company was founded in 1901.</div><div><br></div><div>On the River Tornio and River Muonio logs were floated in rafts. When floated separately, logs had to be collected between booms into a ‚Äúpyr√§‚Äù and towed across the lakes.</div><div>The last float of Lapland was in 1991.</div><div><br></div><div>The float was started after the ice broke and continued until all the logs collected over the winter had been floated to the river mouths.</div><div>Before the ice broke, float tools were prepped. These included wooden staves, poles, handles for pikes, and the maintenance of boats. When the ice broke the preparation of the water channels began. In smaller rivers, guides called ‚Äúotvotus‚Äù and dams called ‚Äútammi‚Äù were built to control the water flow. In big rivers, guide booms were laid.</div><div><br></div><div>At the beginning of the float, the logs were rolled into the water by hand. They could also be stored on the ice during the winter, falling into the water on their own as the ice broke.</div><div><br></div><div>Floats had multiple work phases. In tricky spots, controllers would observe the flow 24/7. In rivers the most labor intensive part was the floating of the final logs, where logs stuck ashore were dragged back into the water.</div><div><br></div><div>The workdays for floaters were often 15-16 hours. Sometimes work through multiple days without rest was necessary. Pay was in hourly wages. In early floats, overtime and night work had no extra pay.</div><div>Float cabins were only situated on the biggest rivers. Local floaters would often sleep in their homes. In creek floats towards river beginnings, floaters would slept at logging camp cabins as well as lean-tos and tents.</div></div><div><br></div>"

          "text": "<div><div><div>In 1912, Tulppio hosted the first mechanized logging camp in Finland. For this camp, Hugo Richard Sandberg, the forestry chief of the Kemi Company, ordered two steam locomotives from America.</div><div><br></div><div>The locomotive has two vertical, double-cylinder steam engines, which power the drive systems. The engines generated about 100 horsepower, and its speed was always 7,5 km/h, regardless of load.</div><div><br></div><div>Behind the engine were attached 5-9 pairs of sleds and each sled was loaded with 50-80 logs. The combined weight of the engine and its load was 56-138 tons.</div><div>The locomotive was highly dependent on the quality of the road. Before the winter, the road was leveled and snow was packed down by foot by hundreds of men. Once the road froze, tracks were driven into it. Alongside the road were several watering and fueling stations.</div><div><br></div><div>The engines were prone to falling over. During the first winter, one of the engines fell over twice, and hauling it back upright was hard work.</div><div><br></div><div>The transportation of the two engines to Nuortti, each of which weighed 16 tons, was a massive undertaking considering the circumstances. The first engine was shipped to Hanko and transported from there to Rovaniemi by rail in 1913. In Rovaniemi the entire locomotive was taken apart. The largest single piece was the steam boiler, weighing in at 7 tons. This had to be transported with a specially made sled, drawn by 12 horses. Two of the horses fell ill due to the heavy strain.</div><div><br></div><div>The steam boiler fell over twice during transportation, but despite the setback the camp was underway by the 21st of February, 1913. The other engine was brought to Nuortti during the second winter of the camp. The transportation costs for these engines were immense.</div><div><br></div><div>In the third winter the engines started to experience more and more faults. The long distance by sea and WWI both made getting spare parts from America difficult. An attempt was made to source parts within the country, but some of these proved to be low in quality. The availability of horses was also low due to the war. After the war ended, the logging camp did not resume work.</div></div></div><div><br></div>"
